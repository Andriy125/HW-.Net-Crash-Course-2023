# TOPIC: Delegates. Multicast Delegates

# Task 1:

Create class Calculator, using Delegates as operations.
Calculator can calculate :-) next operations : +, -, *, / , sin(x), cos(x), tg(x). Operands can be integer (Int32) or real (Double).
All operations should be implemented as delegates, and body can be changed while execution.
!Donâ€™t use if, switch or ?:-operator while operation definition. Try to use Dictionary<> as container for delegates.
*Calculator can work with string which contains several operands and operations. You should also validate operations and operands. Your calculator should never throw errors and crush (use exceptions to process exceptions). Colorfull console is preferred
